# responsive stylish elephants

WIP

An attempt to convert billperegoy's [elm-page-layout](https://github.com/billperegoy/elm-page-layout) to use [stylish-elephants 4.0.0](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/mdgriffith/stylish-elephants/4.0.0)

The author published an [excellent article](https://becoming-functional.com/responsive-design-with-elm-style-elements-9d0eca8eb9ed) about his use of style-elements.

## Getting started

You need to have [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) 0.18 installed on your machine.

Clone this repo.

Then generate it from within the new project's root directory using:

    elm reactor

And view it:
    localhost:8000/src/Main.elm
